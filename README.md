## Structure-based modeling of Cys- and Ser- disease variants of human proteome

### Motivation
There are many disease-associated mutations that endow pharmacological target (typically a protein), drug resistance, e.g. G12C amino acid substitution in oncogenic target KRAS.
People carrying such mutations may need the development of personalized drugs, that take into account structural peculiarities of the mutated protein.
One of the promising strategies is to develop covalent drugs that are specific for a given mutation.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to model structures of human proteins with disease-associated amino acid substitutions. Two types of amino acid substitutions are selected: X to Cysteine or X to Serine (X is any amino acid residue) -- these residues are often used as the attachment points for covalent drugs. 

### Outcome
The obtained structural models will be used as the starting conformations for the structure-based drug design pipelines.
